              <p class="description"><strong> Description: </strong> Popspotz is an app that allows users to search, rate and add pop-ups.</p>
              <p class="description"><strong> Inspiration: </strong> This project came out of collaboration with another colleague. He and I are huge fans of popups but felt that there wasn't a great way to find them. Popspotz is an attempt to bridge this gap and help users in searching and sharing the popups in a more streamlined manner.</p>

              <p class="description"><strong> What's next? </strong>We are working on adding filtering and sorting of results as well as using user's current location to help find popups nearest to them!</p>

              <p class="description"><strong> Description: </strong> Frugaleater is an app that helps users in finding cheap eats, specifically everything under $10, using the Locu API.</p>
              <p class="description"><strong> Inspiration: </strong> I am a huge foodie and the epitome of a frugal eater. As an avid user of Yelp and other such food-related apps, I always found it hard to search for a dish that was specifically $10 or less. Frugaleater is a search engine for finding such cheap eats.</p>

              <p class="description"><strong> Description: </strong>Chatbuddy is a simple chat app built using Meteor.</p>
              <p class="description"><strong> Inspiration: </strong>This app was built as part of my research project. I was really keen on learning how to add chat functionality to any app. After some research, it seemed like Meteor would be ideal for trying that. So I kept it really simple and basic. This was literally created in 30 mins but it does exactly what it's supposed to.</p>
              <p class="description"><strong> Technologies: </strong> Meteorjs <p>
              <p class="description"><strong> What's next? </strong>I would like to allow users to add friends on github and actually chat with other developers they know rather than complete strangers.</p>
